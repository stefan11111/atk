-		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-		       Version 2, June 1991
-
- Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-    		    59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
- numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
-
-			    Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-
-  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
-specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
-other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
-your libraries, too.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
-you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
-code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
-complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
-with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
-the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
-permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
-library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
-version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
-the original authors' reputations.
-
-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
-software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
-transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
-we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
-free use or not licensed at all.
-
-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
-GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
-license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
-designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
-one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
-the same as in the ordinary license.
-
-  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
-they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
-program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
-changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
-analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
-a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
-derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
-treats it as such.
-
-  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
-Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
-sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
-concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
-
-  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
-users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
-libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
-permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
-preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
-libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
-this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
-changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
-will lead to faster development of free libraries.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
-"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
-former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
-works together with the library.
-
-  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
-General Public License rather than by this special one.
-
-		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
-contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
-party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
-General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
-addressed as "you".
-
-  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
-
-  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
-which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
-Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-included without limitation in the term "modification".)
-
-  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
-and installation of the library.
-
-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
-and what the program that uses the Library does.
-  
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
-Library.
-
-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
-fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
-
-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
-    in the event an application does not supply such function or
-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-    its purpose remains meaningful.
-
-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
-    root function must still compute square roots.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
-it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Library.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
-these notices.
-
-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
-
-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
-the Library into a program that is not a library.
-
-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
-linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
-
-  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
-contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
-
-  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
-
-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
-
-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
-link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
-engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
-of these things:
-
-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
-    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
-    to use the modified definitions.)
-
-    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
-    least three years, to give the same user the materials
-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
-    than the cost of performing this distribution.
-
-    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
-    specified materials from the same place.
-
-    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
-
-  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
-Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
-the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
-distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
-the executable.
-
-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
-distribute.
-
-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
-
-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
-    Sections above.
-
-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-
-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Library or works based on it.
-
-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
-this License.
-
-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
-written in the body of this License.
-
-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
-"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
-the Free Software Foundation.
-
-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
-and reuse of software generally.
-
-			    NO WARRANTY
-
-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
-AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-DAMAGES.
-
-		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
-
-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
-ordinary General Public License).
-
-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
-"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
-    Library General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
-    License along with this library; if not, write to the 
-    Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, 
-    Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA.
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
-  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
-
-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
-  Ty Coon, President of Vice
-
-That's all there is to it!

-Atk is part of the GNOME git repository. With git, we no longer
-maintain a ChangeLog file, but you are expected to produce a meaningful
-commit message. Changes without a sufficient commit message will be
-reverted. The expected format for git commit messages is as follows:
-
-=== begin example commit ===
-Short explanation of the commit
-
-Longer explanation explaining exactly what's changed, whether any
-external or private interfaces changed, what bugs were fixed (with bug
-tracker reference if applicable) and so forth. Be concise but not too brief.
-=== end example commit ===
-
-  - Always add a brief description of the commit to the _first_ line of
-    the commit and terminate by two newlines (it will work without the
-    second newline, but that is not nice for the interfaces).
-
-  - First line (the brief description) must only be one sentence and
-    should start with a capital letter unless it starts with a lowercase
-    symbol or identifier. Don't use a trailing period either. Don't exceed
-    72 characters.
-
-  - The main description (the body) is normal prose and should use normal
-    punctuation and capital letters where appropriate. Normally, for patches
-    sent to a mailing list it's copied from there.
-
-  - When committing code on behalf of others use the --author option, e.g.
-    git commit -a --author "Joe Coder <joe@coder.org>" and --signoff.

-Building ATK with Visual Studio
-===============================
-
-Meson is now the supported method of building ATK using Visual Studio.
-
-Building ATK requires GLib, which should preferably be built with the
-same compiler that is now being used to build ATK.  If building the
-introspection files are desired, GObject-Introspection is also needed.
-
-You will need the following tools to build ATK, in addition to Visual
-Studio (2008 and later are supported).
-
--Python 3.6.x.  You will then need to install or update Meson by using pip.
--The Ninja build tool, required for Visual Studio 2008, 2012 and 2013 builds,
- and optional for 2010, 2015 and 2017 builds, where Visual Studio projects
- can be generated instead of the Ninja build files.
--GIT for Windows is highly recommended, in the case where some required
- dependencies are not found, and Meson makes use of GIT to download
- the sources to build in the build process.
--pkg-config or pkgconf is highly recommended (pkg-config is used to denote
- this from this point on).  Note that pkg-config 0.29.1 and later can be
- built with Visual Studio directly from the sources since we need GLib here
- already.  Note that the pkg-config files for GLib needs to be found by
- pkg-config, possibly by setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH in the current Visual Studio
- command prompt to contain the path that GLib's pkg-config files are located.
-
-Note that you will need GLib, which should preferably be built with the
-same compiler that is now being used to build GLib.  As GLib and
-GObject-Introspection are also built using Meson on Visual Studio, ensure that
-their pkg-config (.pc) files can be found by pkg-config, possibly
-by setting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable in the Visual Studio
-command prompt that is being used to build ATK.
-
-One can also refer to the following page for building the dependencies:
-
-https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GTK%2B/Win32/MSVCCompilationOfGTKStack
-
-To do a build using Meson, do the following:
-
--Open a Visual Studio (or SDK) command prompt that matches the Visual Studio
- version and build platform (Win32/x86, x64, etc.) that will be used in all
- the following steps.
-
--Create an empty directory/folder for the build.  It needs to be in the same
- drive as where your ATK sources are located (i.e. $(ATK_SRCDIR)).  cd into
- that directory/folder.
-
--Setup your PATH envvar:
-
-   set PATH=%PATH%;$(PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR);$(NINJA_DIR)
-
- where PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR is where Python 3.6.x+ is installed to, and NINJA_DIR
- is where your ninja executable can be found.  The NINJA_DIR can be omitted if one
- passes --backend=vs to the Meson configuration line, for Visual Studio 2010, 2015
- and 2017 builds.
-
--Configure the build using Meson:
-
-    python $(PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR)\scripts\meson.py $(ATK_SRCDIR) --buildtype=$(build_configuration) --prefix=$(INSTALL_PREFIX) [--backend=vs]
-
- Please see the Meson docs for an explanation for --buildtype, the path passed for
- --prefix need not to be on the same drive as where the build is carried out, but
- it is recommended to use forward slashes for this path.  The --backend=vs can be
- used if the Visual Studio project generator is preferred over using Ninja, for
- Visual Studio 2010, 2015 and 2017 builds.
-
--Build, test and install the build:
- Run ninja (and ninja test and ninja install) or open the generated Visual Studio
- projects to compile, test and install the build.
-
-Note that if building the sources with Visual Studio 2008, note the following
-additional items:
-
--You need to run the following lines from your build directory, to embed the manifests
- that are generated during the build, assuming the built binaries are installed
- to $(PREFIX), after a successful build/installation:
-
-for /r %f in (*.dll.manifest) do if exist $(PREFIX)\bin\%~nf mt /manifest %f $(PREFIX)\bin\%~nf;2
-for /r %f in (*.exe.manifest) do if exist $(PREFIX)\bin\%~nf mt /manifest %f $(PREFIX)\bin\%~nf;1

- * SECTION:atkaction
- * @Short_description: The ATK interface provided by UI components
- * which the user can activate/interact with.
- * @Title:AtkAction
- *
- * #AtkAction should be implemented by instances of #AtkObject classes
- * with which the user can interact directly, i.e. buttons,
- * checkboxes, scrollbars, e.g. components which are not "passive"
- * providers of UI information.
- *
- * Exceptions: when the user interaction is already covered by another
- * appropriate interface such as #AtkEditableText (insert/delete text,
- * etc.) or #AtkValue (set value) then these actions should not be
- * exposed by #AtkAction as well.
- *
- * Though most UI interactions on components should be invocable via
- * keyboard as well as mouse, there will generally be a close mapping
- * between "mouse actions" that are possible on a component and the
- * AtkActions.  Where mouse and keyboard actions are redundant in
- * effect, #AtkAction should expose only one action rather than
- * exposing redundant actions if possible.  By convention we have been
- * using "mouse centric" terminology for #AtkAction names.

- * Gets the keybinding which can be used to activate this action, if one

- * be in the format "mnemonic;sequence;shortcut".
- *
- * - The mnemonic key activates the object if it is presently enabled onscreen.
- *   This typically corresponds to the underlined letter within the widget.
- *   Example: "n" in a traditional "New..." menu item or the "a" in "Apply" for
- *   a button.
- * - The sequence is the full list of keys which invoke the action even if the
- *   relevant element is not currently shown on screen. For instance, for a menu
- *   item the sequence is the keybindings used to open the parent menus before
- *   invoking. The sequence string is colon-delimited. Example: "Alt+F:N" in a
- *   traditional "New..." menu item.
- * - The shortcut, if it exists, will invoke the same action without showing
- *   the component or its enclosing menus or dialogs. Example: "Ctrl+N" in a
- *   traditional "New..." menu item.
- *
- * Example: For a traditional "New..." menu item, the expected return value
- * would be: "N;Alt+F:N;Ctrl+N" for the English locale and "N;Alt+D:N;Strg+N"
- * for the German locale. If, hypothetically, this menu item lacked a mnemonic,
- * it would be represented by ";;Ctrl+N" and ";;Strg+N" respectively.

- * SECTION:atkhyperlinkimpl
- * @Short_description: An interface from which the AtkHyperlink
- *  associated with an AtkObject may be obtained.
- * @Title:AtkHyperlinImpl
- *
- * AtkHyperlinkImpl allows AtkObjects to refer to their associated
- * AtkHyperlink instance, if one exists.  AtkHyperlinkImpl differs
- * from AtkHyperlink in that AtkHyperlinkImpl is an interface, whereas
- * AtkHyperlink is a object type.  The AtkHyperlinkImpl interface
- * allows a client to query an AtkObject for the availability of an
- * associated AtkHyperlink instance, and obtain that instance.  It is
- * thus particularly useful in cases where embedded content or inline
- * content within a text object is present, since the embedding text
- * object implements AtkHypertext and the inline/embedded objects are
- * exposed as children which implement AtkHyperlinkImpl, in addition
- * to their being obtainable via AtkHypertext:getLink followed by
- * AtkHyperlink:getObject.
- *
- * The AtkHyperlinkImpl interface should be supported by objects
- * exposed within the hierarchy as children of an AtkHypertext
- * container which correspond to "links" or embedded content within
- * the text.  HTML anchors are not, for instance, normally exposed
- * this way, but embedded images and components which appear inline in
- * the content of a text object are. The AtkHyperlinkIface interface
- * allows a means of determining which children are hyperlinks in this
- * sense of the word, and for obtaining their corresponding
- * AtkHyperlink object, from which the embedding range, URI, etc. can
- * be obtained.
- *
- * To some extent this interface exists because, for historical
- * reasons, AtkHyperlink was defined as an object type, not an
- * interface.  Thus, in order to interact with AtkObjects via
- * AtkHyperlink semantics, a new interface was required.

- * SECTION:atksocket
- * @Short_description: Container for AtkPlug objects from other processes
- * @Title: AtkSocket
- * @See_also: #AtkPlug
- *
- * Together with #AtkPlug, #AtkSocket provides the ability to embed
- * accessibles from one process into another in a fashion that is
- * transparent to assistive technologies. #AtkSocket works as the
- * container of #AtkPlug, embedding it using the method
- * atk_socket_embed(). Any accessible contained in the #AtkPlug will
- * appear to the assistive technologies as being inside the
- * application that created the #AtkSocket.
- *
- * The communication between a #AtkSocket and a #AtkPlug is done by
- * the IPC layer of the accessibility framework, normally implemented
- * by the D-Bus based implementation of AT-SPI (at-spi2). If that is
- * the case, at-spi-atk2 is the responsible to implement the abstract
- * methods atk_plug_get_id() and atk_socket_embed(), so an ATK
- * implementor shouldn't reimplement them. The process that contains
- * the #AtkPlug is responsible to send the ID returned by
- * atk_plug_id() to the process that contains the #AtkSocket, so it
- * could call the method atk_socket_embed() in order to embed it.
- *
- * For the same reasons, an implementor doesn't need to implement
- * atk_object_get_n_accessible_children() and
- * atk_object_ref_accessible_child(). All the logic related to those
- * functions will be implemented by the IPC layer.

-/**
- *AtkStateType:
- *@ATK_STATE_INVALID: Indicates an invalid state - probably an error condition.
- *@ATK_STATE_ACTIVE: Indicates a window is currently the active window, or an object is the active subelement within a container or table. ATK_STATE_ACTIVE should not be used for objects which have ATK_STATE_FOCUSABLE or ATK_STATE_SELECTABLE: Those objects should use ATK_STATE_FOCUSED and ATK_STATE_SELECTED respectively. ATK_STATE_ACTIVE is a means to indicate that an object which is not focusable and not selectable is the currently-active item within its parent container.
- *@ATK_STATE_ARMED: Indicates that the object is 'armed', i.e. will be activated by if a pointer button-release event occurs within its bounds.  Buttons often enter this state when a pointer click occurs within their bounds, as a precursor to activation. ATK_STATE_ARMED has been deprecated since ATK-2.16 and should not be used in newly-written code.
- *@ATK_STATE_BUSY:  Indicates the current object is busy, i.e. onscreen representation is in the process of changing, or the object is temporarily unavailable for interaction due to activity already in progress.  This state may be used by implementors of Document to indicate that content loading is underway.  It also may indicate other 'pending' conditions; clients may wish to interrogate this object when the ATK_STATE_BUSY flag is removed.
- *@ATK_STATE_CHECKED: Indicates this object is currently checked, for instance a checkbox is 'non-empty'.
- *@ATK_STATE_DEFUNCT: Indicates that this object no longer has a valid backing widget (for instance, if its peer object has been destroyed)
- *@ATK_STATE_EDITABLE: Indicates that this object can contain text, and that the
- * user can change the textual contents of this object by editing those contents
- * directly. For an object which is expected to be editable due to its type, but
- * which cannot be edited due to the application or platform preventing the user
- * from doing so, that object's #AtkStateSet should lack ATK_STATE_EDITABLE and
- * should contain ATK_STATE_READ_ONLY.
- *@ATK_STATE_ENABLED: 	Indicates that this object is enabled, i.e. that it currently reflects some application state. Objects that are "greyed out" may lack this state, and may lack the STATE_SENSITIVE if direct user interaction cannot cause them to acquire STATE_ENABLED. See also: ATK_STATE_SENSITIVE
- *@ATK_STATE_EXPANDABLE: Indicates this object allows progressive disclosure of its children
- *@ATK_STATE_EXPANDED: Indicates this object its expanded - see ATK_STATE_EXPANDABLE above
- *@ATK_STATE_FOCUSABLE: Indicates this object can accept keyboard focus, which means all events resulting from typing on the keyboard will normally be passed to it when it has focus
- *@ATK_STATE_FOCUSED: Indicates this object currently has the keyboard focus
- *@ATK_STATE_HORIZONTAL: Indicates the orientation of this object is horizontal; used, for instance, by objects of ATK_ROLE_SCROLL_BAR.  For objects where vertical/horizontal orientation is especially meaningful.
- *@ATK_STATE_ICONIFIED: Indicates this object is minimized and is represented only by an icon
- *@ATK_STATE_MODAL: Indicates something must be done with this object before the user can interact with an object in a different window
- *@ATK_STATE_MULTI_LINE: Indicates this (text) object can contain multiple lines of text
- *@ATK_STATE_MULTISELECTABLE: Indicates this object allows more than one of its children to be selected at the same time, or in the case of text objects, that the object supports non-contiguous text selections.
- *@ATK_STATE_OPAQUE: Indicates this object paints every pixel within its rectangular region.
- *@ATK_STATE_PRESSED: Indicates this object is currently pressed.
- *@ATK_STATE_RESIZABLE: Indicates the size of this object is not fixed
- *@ATK_STATE_SELECTABLE: Indicates this object is the child of an object that allows its children to be selected and that this child is one of those children that can be selected
- *@ATK_STATE_SELECTED: Indicates this object is the child of an object that allows its children to be selected and that this child is one of those children that has been selected
- *@ATK_STATE_SENSITIVE: Indicates this object is sensitive, e.g. to user interaction. 
- * STATE_SENSITIVE usually accompanies STATE_ENABLED for user-actionable controls,
- * but may be found in the absence of STATE_ENABLED if the current visible state of the 
- * control is "disconnected" from the application state.  In such cases, direct user interaction
- * can often result in the object gaining STATE_SENSITIVE, for instance if a user makes 
- * an explicit selection using an object whose current state is ambiguous or undefined.
- * @see STATE_ENABLED, STATE_INDETERMINATE.
- *@ATK_STATE_SHOWING: Indicates this object, the object's parent, the object's parent's parent, and so on, 
- * are all 'shown' to the end-user, i.e. subject to "exposure" if blocking or obscuring objects do not interpose
- * between this object and the top of the window stack.
- *@ATK_STATE_SINGLE_LINE: Indicates this (text) object can contain only a single line of text
- *@ATK_STATE_STALE: Indicates that the information returned for this object may no longer be
- * synchronized with the application state.  This is implied if the object has STATE_TRANSIENT,
- * and can also occur towards the end of the object peer's lifecycle. It can also be used to indicate that 
- * the index associated with this object has changed since the user accessed the object (in lieu of
- * "index-in-parent-changed" events).
- *@ATK_STATE_TRANSIENT: Indicates this object is transient, i.e. a snapshot which may not emit events when its
- * state changes.  Data from objects with ATK_STATE_TRANSIENT should not be cached, since there may be no
- * notification given when the cached data becomes obsolete.
- *@ATK_STATE_VERTICAL: Indicates the orientation of this object is vertical
- *@ATK_STATE_VISIBLE: Indicates this object is visible, e.g. has been explicitly marked for exposure to the user.
- * **note**: %ATK_STATE_VISIBLE is no guarantee that the object is actually unobscured on the screen, only
- * that it is 'potentially' visible, barring obstruction, being scrolled or clipped out of the 
- * field of view, or having an ancestor container that has not yet made visible.
- * A widget is potentially onscreen if it has both %ATK_STATE_VISIBLE and %ATK_STATE_SHOWING.
- * The absence of %ATK_STATE_VISIBLE and %ATK_STATE_SHOWING is semantically equivalent to saying
- * that an object is 'hidden'.  See also %ATK_STATE_TRUNCATED, which applies if an object with
- * %ATK_STATE_VISIBLE and %ATK_STATE_SHOWING set lies within a viewport which means that its
- * contents are clipped, e.g. a truncated spreadsheet cell or
- * an image within a scrolling viewport.  Mostly useful for screen-review and magnification
- * algorithms.
- *@ATK_STATE_MANAGES_DESCENDANTS: Indicates that "active-descendant-changed" event
- * is sent when children become 'active' (i.e. are selected or navigated to onscreen).
- * Used to prevent need to enumerate all children in very large containers, like tables.
- * The presence of STATE_MANAGES_DESCENDANTS is an indication to the client.
- * that the children should not, and need not, be enumerated by the client.
- * Objects implementing this state are expected to provide relevant state
- * notifications to listening clients, for instance notifications of visibility
- * changes and activation of their contained child objects, without the client 
- * having previously requested references to those children.
- *@ATK_STATE_INDETERMINATE: Indicates that the value, or some other quantifiable
- * property, of this AtkObject cannot be fully determined. In the case of a large
- * data set in which the total number of items in that set is unknown (e.g. 1 of
- * 999+), implementors should expose the currently-known set size (999) along
- * with this state. In the case of a check box, this state should be used to
- * indicate that the check box is a tri-state check box which is currently
- * neither checked nor unchecked.
- *@ATK_STATE_TRUNCATED: Indicates that an object is truncated, e.g. a text value in a speradsheet cell.
- *@ATK_STATE_REQUIRED: Indicates that explicit user interaction with an object is required by the user interface, e.g. a required field in a "web-form" interface.
- *@ATK_STATE_INVALID_ENTRY: Indicates that the object has encountered an error condition due to failure of input validation. For instance, a form control may acquire this state in response to invalid or malformed user input.
- *@ATK_STATE_SUPPORTS_AUTOCOMPLETION:  Indicates that the object in question implements some form of ¬®typeahead¬® or 
- * pre-selection behavior whereby entering the first character of one or more sub-elements
- * causes those elements to scroll into view or become selected.  Subsequent character input
- * may narrow the selection further as long as one or more sub-elements match the string.
- * This state is normally only useful and encountered on objects that implement Selection.
- * In some cases the typeahead behavior may result in full or partial ¬®completion¬® of 
- * the data in the input field, in which case these input events may trigger text-changed
- * events from the AtkText interface.  This state supplants @ATK_ROLE_AUTOCOMPLETE.
- *@ATK_STATE_SELECTABLE_TEXT:Indicates that the object in question supports text selection. It should only be exposed on objects which implement the Text interface, in order to distinguish this state from @ATK_STATE_SELECTABLE, which infers that the object in question is a selectable child of an object which implements Selection. While similar, text selection and subelement selection are distinct operations.
- *@ATK_STATE_DEFAULT: Indicates that the object is the "default" active component, i.e. the object which is activated by an end-user press of the "Enter" or "Return" key.  Typically a "close" or "submit" button.
- *@ATK_STATE_ANIMATED: Indicates that the object changes its appearance dynamically as an inherent part of its presentation.  This state may come and go if an object is only temporarily animated on the way to a 'final' onscreen presentation.
- * **note**: some applications, notably content viewers, may not be able to detect
- * all kinds of animated content.  Therefore the absence of this state should not
- * be taken as definitive evidence that the object's visual representation is
- * static; this state is advisory.
- *@ATK_STATE_VISITED: Indicates that the object (typically a hyperlink) has already been 'activated', and/or its backing data has already been downloaded, rendered, or otherwise "visited".
- *@ATK_STATE_CHECKABLE: Indicates this object has the potential to be
- *  checked, such as a checkbox or toggle-able table cell. @Since:
- *  ATK-2.12
- *@ATK_STATE_HAS_POPUP: Indicates that the object has a popup context
- * menu or sub-level menu which may or may not be showing. This means
- * that activation renders conditional content.  Note that ordinary
- * tooltips are not considered popups in this context. @Since: ATK-2.12
- *@ATK_STATE_HAS_TOOLTIP: Indicates this object has a tooltip. @Since: ATK-2.16
- *@ATK_STATE_READ_ONLY: Indicates that a widget which is ENABLED and SENSITIVE
- * has a value which can be read, but not modified, by the user. Note that this
- * state should only be applied to widget types whose value is normally directly
- * user modifiable, such as check boxes, radio buttons, spin buttons, text input
- * fields, and combo boxes, as a means to convey that the expected interaction
- * with that widget is not possible. When the expected interaction with a
- * widget does not include modification by the user, as is the case with
- * labels and containers, ATK_STATE_READ_ONLY should not be applied. See also
- * ATK_STATE_EDITABLE. @Since: ATK-2-16
- *@ATK_STATE_COLLAPSED: Indicates this object is collapsed. @Since: ATK-2.38
- *@ATK_STATE_LAST_DEFINED: Not a valid state, used for finding end of enumeration
- *
- *The possible types of states of an object

-/**
- * SECTION:atktable
- * @Short_description: The ATK interface implemented for UI components
- *  which contain tabular or row/column information.
- * @Title:AtkTable
- *
- * #AtkTable should be implemented by components which present
- * elements ordered via rows and columns.  It may also be used to
- * present tree-structured information if the nodes of the trees can
- * be said to contain multiple "columns".  Individual elements of an
- * #AtkTable are typically referred to as "cells". Those cells should
- * implement the interface #AtkTableCell, but #Atk doesn't require
- * them to be direct children of the current #AtkTable. They can be
- * grand-children, grand-grand-children etc. #AtkTable provides the
- * API needed to get a individual cell based on the row and column
- * numbers.
- *
- * Children of #AtkTable are frequently "lightweight" objects, that
- * is, they may not have backing widgets in the host UI toolkit.  They
- * are therefore often transient.
- *
- * Since tables are often very complex, #AtkTable includes provision
- * for offering simplified summary information, as well as row and
- * column headers and captions.  Headers and captions are #AtkObjects
- * which may implement other interfaces (#AtkText, #AtkImage, etc.) as
- * appropriate.  #AtkTable summaries may themselves be (simplified)
- * #AtkTables, etc.
- *
- * Note for implementors: in the past, #AtkTable required that all the
- * cells should be direct children of #AtkTable, and provided some
- * index based methods to request the cells. The practice showed that
- * that forcing made #AtkTable implementation complex, and hard to
- * expose other kind of children, like rows or captions. Right now,
- * index-based methods are deprecated.

- * @Short_description: The ATK interface implemented by components
- *  with text content.
- * @Title:AtkText
- *
- * #AtkText should be implemented by #AtkObjects on behalf of widgets
- * that have text content which is either attributed or otherwise
- * non-trivial.  #AtkObjects whose text content is simple,
- * unattributed, and very brief may expose that content via
- * #atk_object_get_name instead; however if the text is editable,
- * multi-line, typically longer than three or four words, attributed,
- * selectable, or if the object already uses the 'name' ATK property
- * for other information, the #AtkText interface should be used to
- * expose the text content.  In the case of editable text content,
- * #AtkEditableText (a subtype of the #AtkText interface) should be
- * implemented instead.
- *
- *  #AtkText provides not only traversal facilities and change
- * notification for text content, but also caret tracking and glyph
- * bounding box calculations.  Note that the text strings are exposed
- * as UTF-8, and are therefore potentially multi-byte, and
- * caret-to-byte offset mapping makes no assumptions about the
- * character length; also bounding box glyph-to-offset mapping may be
- * complex for languages which use ligatures.

- * atk_add_global_event_listener: (skip)
- * @listener: the listener to notify
- * @event_type: the type of event for which notification is requested
- *
- * Adds the specified function to the list of functions to be called
- * when an ATK event of type event_type occurs.
- *
- * The format of event_type is the following:
- *  "ATK:&lt;atk_type&gt;:&lt;atk_event&gt;:&lt;atk_event_detail&gt;
- *
- * Where "ATK" works as the namespace, &lt;atk_interface&gt; is the name of
- * the ATK type (interface or object), &lt;atk_event&gt; is the name of the
- * signal defined on that interface and &lt;atk_event_detail&gt; is the
- * gsignal detail of that signal. You can find more info about gsignal
- * details here:
- * http://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/gobject-Signals.html
- *
- * The first three parameters are mandatory. The last one is optional.
- *
- * For example:
- *   ATK:AtkObject:state-change
- *   ATK:AtkText:text-selection-changed
- *   ATK:AtkText:text-insert:system
- *
- * Toolkit implementor note: ATK provides a default implementation for
- * this virtual method. ATK implementors are discouraged from
- * reimplementing this method.
- *
- * Toolkit implementor note: this method is not intended to be used by
- * ATK implementors but by ATK consumers.
- *
- * ATK consumers note: as this method adds a listener for a given ATK
- * type, that type should be already registered on the GType system
- * before calling this method. A simple way to do that is creating an
- * instance of #AtkNoOpObject. This class implements all ATK
- * interfaces, so creating the instance will register all ATK types as
- * a collateral effect.
- *
- * Returns: added event listener id, or 0 on failure.

- * SECTION:atkvalue
- * @Short_description: The ATK interface implemented by valuators and
- *  components which display or select a value from a bounded range of
- *  values.
- * @Title:AtkValue
- *
- * #AtkValue should be implemented for components which either display
- * a value from a bounded range, or which allow the user to specify a
- * value from a bounded range, or both. For instance, most sliders and
- * range controls, as well as dials, should have #AtkObject
- * representations which implement #AtkValue on the component's
- * behalf. #AtKValues may be read-only, in which case attempts to
- * alter the value return would fail.
- *
- * <refsect1 id="current-value-text">
- * <title>On the subject of current value text</title>
- * <para>
- * In addition to providing the current value, implementors can
- * optionally provide an end-user-consumable textual description
- * associated with this value. This description should be included
- * when the numeric value fails to convey the full, on-screen
- * representation seen by users.
- * </para>
- *
- * <example>
- * <title>Password strength</title>
- * A password strength meter whose value changes as the user types
- * their new password. Red is used for values less than 4.0, yellow
- * for values between 4.0 and 7.0, and green for values greater than
- * 7.0. In this instance, value text should be provided by the
- * implementor. Appropriate value text would be "weak", "acceptable,"
- * and "strong" respectively.
- * </example>
- *
- * A level bar whose value changes to reflect the battery charge. The
- * color remains the same regardless of the charge and there is no
- * on-screen text reflecting the fullness of the battery. In this
- * case, because the position within the bar is the only indication
- * the user has of the current charge, value text should not be
- * provided by the implementor.
- *
- * <refsect2 id="implementor-notes">
- * <title>Implementor Notes</title>
- * <para>
- * Implementors should bear in mind that assistive technologies will
- * likely prefer the value text provided over the numeric value when
- * presenting a widget's value. As a result, strings not intended for
- * end users should not be exposed in the value text, and strings
- * which are exposed should be localized. In the case of widgets which
- * display value text on screen, for instance through a separate label
- * in close proximity to the value-displaying widget, it is still
- * expected that implementors will expose the value text using the
- * above API.
- * </para>
- *
- * <para>
- * #AtkValue should NOT be implemented for widgets whose displayed
- * value is not reflective of a meaningful amount. For instance, a
- * progress pulse indicator whose value alternates between 0.0 and 1.0
- * to indicate that some process is still taking place should not
- * implement #AtkValue because the current value does not reflect
- * progress towards completion.

- * </refsect1>
- *
- * <refsect1 id="ranges">
- * <title>On the subject of ranges</title>
- * <para>
- * In addition to providing the minimum and maximum values,
- * implementors can optionally provide details about subranges
- * associated with the widget. These details should be provided by the
- * implementor when both of the following are communicated visually to
- * the end user:
- * </para>
- * <itemizedlist>
- *   <listitem>The existence of distinct ranges such as "weak",
- *   "acceptable", and "strong" indicated by color, bar tick marks,
- *   and/or on-screen text.</listitem>
- *   <listitem>Where the current value stands within a given subrange,
- *   for instance illustrating progression from very "weak" towards
- *   nearly "acceptable" through changes in shade and/or position on
- *   the bar within the "weak" subrange.</listitem>
- * </itemizedlist>
- * <para>
- * If both of the above do not apply to the widget, it should be
- * sufficient to expose the numeric value, along with the value text
- * if appropriate, to make the widget accessible.
- * </para>
- *
- * <refsect2 id="ranges-implementor-notes">
- * <title>Implementor Notes</title>
- * <para>
- * If providing subrange details is deemed necessary, all possible
- * values of the widget are expected to fall within one of the
- * subranges defined by the implementor.

- *
- * <refsect1 id="localization">
- * <title>On the subject of localization of end-user-consumable text

- * directly presented to end users via their assistive technology. In
- * order to simplify this for implementors, implementors can use

-    <title>Overview</title>
-     <para>
-       GNOME provides support for accessibility devices using the ATK
-       framework. This framework defines a set of interfaces to which
-       graphical interface components adhere. This allows, for instance,
-       screen readers to read the text of an interface and interact with its
-       controls. ATK support is built into GTK+ and the rest of the GNOME
-       platform, so any application using GTK+ will have reasonable
-       accessibility support for free.
-     </para>
-
-     <para>
-     Nonetheless, you should be aware of accessibility issues when when
-     developing your applications. Although GTK+ interfaces provide
-     reasonable accessibility by default, you can often improve how well
-     your program behaves with accessibility tools by providing additional
-     information to ATK. If you develop custom widgets, you should ensure
-     that they expose their properties to ATK
